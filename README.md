# Royal College of Art Poster Archive

A project archiving the RCA's posters of the past 75 years.

This site will be run using Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages.

## Project

This project looks at the archive as a problem.

Archives are static and secure, and this cna stop people from being able to explore and chance upon entries.

By randomly changing the way the archive is ordered, and ordering based on properties other than date or author, you can make an archive that is also a source of inspiration and free discovery.
