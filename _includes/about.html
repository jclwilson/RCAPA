<p><cite>Royal College of Art Poster Archive</cite> is aÂ generative online archive catalogue, which holds several thousand posters from the last 80 Years at the Royal College of Art. The catalogue presents users with a randomly chosen selection of images,
	based upon predefined characteristics, which aims to allow for more of a serendipitous approach towards working with an archival collection. This platform also allows current students at the RCA to upload new work to the archive, as well as comment and
	update the information, to encourage the archive to grow and exist in a new generative platform (to do so please follow the links below). These posters were digitised and catalogued by a small team in the summer of 2017.</p>
<p>This website is primarily for sharing selective information collected for a research project within the Royal College of Art, on student works and material. It is a reference tool and searchable database containing material intended for personal, educational
	and non-commercial purposes such as teaching, research, evaluation and commentary.</p>
